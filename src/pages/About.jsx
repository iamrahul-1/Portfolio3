          I&apos;m a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer based in Ahmedabad,
          India. Currently in my final semester at Indira Gandhi National
          University, I&apos;m focused on both frontend and backend development,
          with hands-on experience in creating dynamic, user-friendly web
          applications. <br />
          <br />I recently completed a 1-month internship in web development at
          Unified Mentor, where I gained practical knowledge of technologies
          like React JS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, Bootstrap, HTML,
          CSS, Redux Toolkit, and Firebase. During my internship, I worked on
          developing and refining web applications, learning how to optimize
          both performance and user experience.
          <br />
          <br /> In addition to my internship, I have had the opportunity to
          freelance, where I apply my full-stack development skills to build
          responsive, scalable web applications for various clients. My
          responsibilities included designing frontend architectures,
          integrating features like chatbots, and ensuring that the websites
          were responsive and user-friendly. Notable Projects: Pexel Perfect:
          Developed a fully responsive web application optimized for flawless
          performance across all devices. Smart brain & Mushroom essence:
          Contributed to impactful projects during my internship, focusing on
          responsive design and functionality. With a strong eye for detail,
          excellent problem-solving skills, and a passion for continuous
          learning, I&apos;m excited about tackling new challenges and
          delivering high-quality digital solutions. Whether it&apos;s a
          freelance project or a full-time opportunity, I&apos;m eager to bring
          creative ideas and technical expertise to your team.
